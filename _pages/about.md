Hi, I'm Matt. *waves*. I began my journey as a programmer around 2012, when I got my first personal laptop. Within this blog, I plan on sharing some things I've learned over the years, as well as explain new things I learn to make sure I learn them well.

If you'd like to chat about anything feel free to use the links available on the footer.

**NOTE:** this blog is built using open-source code, available [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). Thanks to the amazing developers for building it!
